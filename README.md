basically linux but in a web browser
it isnt linux, but the goal is for linux compatibility
this contains the source code and the repo for building it
some things about this:
- you can store data to a "hard drive" (its really just a virtual file system contained in a file)
- you can load data into it
- you can install stuff

  this could be good on chromebooks and might be useful for embeddding stuff
